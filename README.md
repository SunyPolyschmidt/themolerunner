# Mole-Runner
### Taylor Schmidt
## Summary
Mole Runner is a 2D running game. The player character (the mole) will run to the right dodging obstacles that the player must jump over. As time goes on more obstacles will appear and the players speed will increase. The game will end when the play character hits an obstacle. A score for the player will be calculated based on how long the player ran for.
#### Controls
To jump over obstacles the player will tap on a phone.
The mole is in a fixed position so that the player only need to worry about dodging obstacles. Jumps will be a fixed arc.
#### Obstacles
+ Grounded Rocks that must be **Jumped** over
#### Code
The Project will use the Flame Engine for Dart library for the game loop and the visuals.
